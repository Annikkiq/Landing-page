# Landing Page Project

## About this project 
This my second project for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree program.

I downloaded a starter template from https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page and added JavaScript to make the page functional. 

This is a single page project that contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To get started you just need to download ZIP files or clone the repository and once that's done, open index.html with live-server.

## List of references
I am fairly new to JavaScript and I used a lot of time for researching and learning.
